# Why?
I created this script for 2 reasons, the first one is that most of the time I do not feel confortable manually editing the fstab file, the second one is that I was bored

# Usage

to use this script you just need to run it as sudo via bash and specify the device and mountpoint

Example:
bash automount.sh /dev/sda1 /mnt
